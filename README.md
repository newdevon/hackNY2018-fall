Qontact, a web app that makes adding new friends easy. Ever run by the hassle of meeting a new friend and needing to ask and add him or her on different social medias? Sometimes things can get difficult when your new friend has a common name and you are searching him up on facebook. With Qontact, you can now add someone you meet and/or share your social medias with a single scan.

Qontact allows you to quickly add new friends on social medias with a QR Scan. Within our web app you can link your social medias and instantly generate a profile that others can scan and instantly access. No more awkward waiting of trying to find your new friend's profile as you will be able to add all their social medias right in the app.

A QR code is generated depending on which social medias you would like to share which will be linked to a URL with your profile. All your new friend needs to do is download the app, create and account and link their social medias once, and start scanning away.
Since we have an account system, we use php and python for our database storing social medias, user information, this in return provides a template in which we can draw information from.

Features: 

Acquaintance, Old Friend, or Professional Employer?

Within your accounts, you can create profiles catered to who you would like to share to. Different profiles can show different social medias or professional platforms and are highly customizable. Want to add a new friend, but not share everything on the fly, you can make a profile for that which will generate a different QR code just for that profile with those social medias. Talking to an employer and want to share your professional platorms such as Linkedin and Github, no problem make a profile for that and just share it!

Version:

Within the 48 hour time span of the Hackathon, I, Riya, Ami, and Gillian were able to create a representation of what we wanted our web app to look like as well as a working database that responds to inputs and returns values. Unfortunately we were unable to link our back-end and front-end together, however we had a working QR scanner and generator on computer as well as on any mobile device. The current demo of the site could be found live on newdevon.github.io another repository in this github!
